My Non-empty README for now!!
This is my innocent attempt at Full-stack cloning The Facebook Web-app
For frontend, Custom CSS together with Vite React is in use
For Backend, Nodejs,Express and MongoDB is in place
With Numerous other dependencies

npm install - to install all dependencies
npm start - to start the backend server locally
npm run dev - to run frontend locally for development

vite build - to build frontend for production

Fully desktop only atm but
Currently working only mobile view !!!
